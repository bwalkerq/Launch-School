# notes on process
- P: restate the problem in my own words, specify input and output
- E: copy past an example to mark it, especially when I develop an algo to keep track of pointers, etc.
  - Here is the time to consider edge cases, and ask questions about potential input
  - with strings, spaces?
- D: I hope that I am able to id the data structure necessary here
- A: remember to build it in plain language, then specifics
  - sometimes working cases is a good way to do it
  - revisit the algo while coding if I need to change it
- Code:
  - remember to build in opportunities to check that the code is working
